## The Rationale 
People are building great open source packages but there is little to no coordination and therefore no interoperability. There needs to be a broader plan so these little 'lego' peices naturally fit together. Coordinate FC aims to act as a [Schelling Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtW-Ds-artA) for people building open source tools hopefully leading to: 

- An agreed mapping of open source needs 
- Agreed standardisation of inputs and outputs 
- Solutions that are data provider agnostic 
- aligned with the needs of industry 
- strategically stable yet decentralised 
- a value add to clubs and data providers 
- welcoming to new enterants 
- verifiable to allow for retroactive funding

## Initial Mapping 
This is an initial attempt to try and map out the potential open source needs for the football analytics space. This is meant to stimulate discussions rather than being an opinion for others to follow.

## Stages of Development 
1. Discussions and Debates
There is a need for a collection of well informed builders to propose, debate and agree on some directions of travel and some standardisations of inputs and outputs between 'legos'. 

2. Development 
Once there is an agreed plan and set of standardisations a long period of development would follow. This would include people starting brand new projects or pre-existing projects that need to adapt to the new standards. 

3. Funding 
Open source tools should be able to bring a huge benefit to a wide range of consumers; from clubs, federations, media companies, player management agencies as well as hobbyist analysts. Coodinate FC should aim to provide a framework to encourage funding of open source tools.
