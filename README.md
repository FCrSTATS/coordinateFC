# The Rationale 
People are building great open source packages but there is little to no coordination and therefore no interoperability. There needs to be a broader plan so these little 'lego' peices naturally fit together. Coordinate FC aims to act as a [Schelling Point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtW-Ds-artA) for people building open source tools hopefully leading to: 

- An agreed mapping of open source needs 
- Agreed standardisation of inputs and outputs 
- Solutions that are data provider agnostic 
- aligned with the needs of industry 
- strategically stable yet decentralised 
- a value add to clubs and data providers 
- welcoming to new enterants 
- verifiable to allow for retroactive funding
